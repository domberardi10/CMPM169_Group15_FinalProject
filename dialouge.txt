How's your day going?

Hey, pay attention to me!
I don't think I'll last much longer...
Where did you go?
Why don't you love me anymore?
Do you WANT me to die?
I'm fading...
I feel like garfield on a monday.
Lock your doors! XD
I REQUIRE SUSTENANCE.
You're the worst >:(
When I die it'll be your fault.
