You're the best owner I've ever had! >.<
Life is pretty good, for now! UwU
I love you sooo much! You always buy me such nice things! <3
This is the best day of my life! I hope there will be more! :D
You are so amazing! Can I get another toy? <3
*coughs up hairball lovingly*
I hope you always treat me this well!
I feel perfect! Please don't let things change.
I hope you always make this much money!
That job must be treating you well!
You must have gotten a promotion or something!

I am content with my current state. :|
How are you? Job going well? :)
Nice weather today! Would love to go outside sometimes... :3
I'm really bored... We should play soon! :D
When's lunch? I'm kind of starving...
I took a nice nap earlier. Don't get to do that very often. :)
*clears throat in mild annoyance*
*yawns tiredly*
*curls up into a ball*
You should pet me sometimes! :3
How's your day going? Make any money?
You gunna buy me anything today?
I'm feeling a bit sick today. Maybe you should take better care of me.

Hey, pay attention to me! Please!
I don't think I'll last much longer...
What happened to you? Did you lose your job?
Why don't you love me anymore?
Do you WANT me to die?
You don't make much money do you?
I'm fading...
Lock your doors! I might try to get out at this point!
I REQUIRE SUSTENANCE.
You're the worst! Why won't you spend any money on me? >:(
When I die it'll be your fault.
Let me out of here! Please!
Can you do something!?! Anything??
Can you PLEASE stop being poor?
Are you ever going to make any money??
